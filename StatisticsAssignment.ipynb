        "\n",
        "Degrees of Freedom: The F-distribution is characterized by two parameters: d1(the numerator degrees of freedom)and d2(the denominator degrees of freedom). These determine the shape and scale of the distribution.\n",

        "Critical Values: The F-distribution is used in hypothesis testing (e.g., ANOVA).\n",
        "Critical values can be obtained from F-distribution tables or calculated using statistical software,\n",
